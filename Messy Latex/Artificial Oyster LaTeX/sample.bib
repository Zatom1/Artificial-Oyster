	abstract = {Aim of this study was to expose phytoplankton to growth conditions simulating deep winter convection in the North Atlantic and thereby to assess changes in physiology enabling their survival. Growth rate, biochemical composition, and photosynthetic activity of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were determined under two different light scenarios over a temperature range of 5–15°C to simulate conditions experienced by cells during winter deep convection. These metrics were examined under a low light scenario (20 µmol m−2 s−1, 12/12 h light/dark), and compared with a scenario of short light pulses of a higher light intensity (120 µmol m−2 s−1, 2/22 h light/dark). Both experimental light conditions offered the same daily light dose. No growth was observed at temperatures below 8°C. Above 8°C, growth rates were significantly higher under low light conditions compared with those of short pulsed light exposures, indicating a higher efficiency of light utilization. This could be related to (i) a higher content of Chl a per cell in the low light trial and/or (ii) a more efficient transfer of light energy into growth as indicated by constantly low carbohydrate levels. In contrast, pulsed intense light led to an accumulation of carbohydrates, which were catabolized during the longer dark period for maintaining metabolism. Light curves measured via Chl a fluorescence indicated low light assimilation for the algae exposed to short pulsed light. We postulate that our trial with short light pluses did not provide sufficient light to reach full light saturation. In general, photosynthesis was more strongly affected by temperature under pulsed light than under low light conditions. Our results indicate that model estimates of primary production in relation to deep convection, which are based on average low light conditions, not considering vertical transportation of algae will lead to an overestimation of in situ primary production.},

	abstract = { Washload and fine sediment load should not be used synonymously. In streams with large concentrations of fines, the sediment size D10 may be much smaller than 0.0625 mm. The fluid becomes very viscous at low concentrations of clays and the reduced settling velocity inhibits the exchange of sediment particles between the bed and the suspension. The sediment transport capacity under those conditions remains very poorly defined. In coarse bed streams, sands and fine gravel can be considered as washload as long as the sediment transport capacity remains larger than the availability of sediment. Intermittently, different conditions prevail when the upstream supply exceeds the transport capacity. }

	abstract = {Marine sediments are a sink for microplastics, making seabed organisms particularly exposed. We used meta-analysis to reveal general patterns in a surge in experimental studies and to test for microplastic impact on biological processes including invertebrate feeding, survival and energetics. Using Hedge's effect size (g), which assesses the mean response of organisms exposed to microplastics compared to control groups, we found negative impacts (significant negative g values) across all life stages (overall effect size (g) = −0.57 95 % CI [−0.76, −0.38]), with embryos most strongly affected (g = −1.47 [−2.21, −0.74]). Six of seven biological process rates were negatively impacted by microplastic exposure, including development, reproduction, growth and feeding. Survival strongly decreased (g = −0.69 [−1.21, −0.17]), likely due to cumulative effects on other processes such as feeding and growth. Among feeding habits, omnivores and deposit feeders were most negatively impacted (g = −0.93 [−1.69, −0.16] and −0.92 [−1.53, −0.31], respectively). The study incorporated the first meta-analysis to contrast the effects of leachates, virgin, aged and contaminated particles. Exposure to leachates had by far the strongest negative effects (g = −0.93 [−1.35, −0.51]), showing studies of contaminants and leachates are critical to future research. Overall, our meta-analysis reveals stronger and more consistent negative impacts of microplastics on seabed invertebrates than recorded for other marine biota. Seabed invertebrates are numerous and diverse, and crucial to bottom-up processes, including nutrient remineralisation, bentho-pelagic coupling and energy transfer through the ocean food web. Marine sediments will store microplastics over long timescales. The reveal that microplastics impinge on multiple fundamental biological processes of seabed fauna implies plastic pollution could have significant and enduring effects on the functioning of the ocean.}

	Net primary production is a fundamental ecological process that reflects the amount of carbon synthesized within an ecosystem, which is ultimately available to consumers. It reveals that aquatic algae are a significant contributor to food webs in tropical rivers and streams. It also shows that the rates of in-stream primary production in tropical regions are typically at least an order of magnitude greater than comparable temperate systems. Although nutrient status can significantly modify rates, the ultimate driver of aquatic primary production is light availability. Flood plains are important for fodder and for nursery habitat for fish, which re-invade main channels when floods recede. Tropical river systems undoubtedly sit at the high end of the global productivity spectrum, and the wet and dry forest catchments they drain have the highest rates of primary production of any terrestrial biome. They are characterized by climatic conditions that often promote year-round growth, with less seasonal variation in solar irradiance than temperate latitudes. Much of the primary production within the channels of streams and rivers, particularly those with fast flowing water, is typically restricted to benthic habitats involving algae and cyanobacteria. Rivers draining undisturbed tropical catchments are low in nutrients and consequently aquatic primary production is low. Macrophytes appear to be the major primary producers within floodplains. Primary production in tropical rivers is variable and typically only a component of overall productivity.}
